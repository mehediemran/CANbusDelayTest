# CANbusDelayTest
programs for sending and receiving data over CAN (Controller Area Network) bus. Transmiting program measures the delay or latency to transmit a burst of data. Receiving program also calculates the delay and finds the missing data. This is created to test the CAN bus transmission delay using Arduino libraries   .
